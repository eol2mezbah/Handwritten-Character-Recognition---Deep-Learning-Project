

Here we are introducing the project 'Hand written character Recognition' with Machine Learning and Tensor flow CNN Models in Colab

Please check the below scope to run this file.

	1. Sign in to your google account.
	2. Go to 'https://drive.google.com'
	3. Navigate 'My Drive' --> 'Colab Notebooks' --> Upload The 'Handwritten Character Recognition.ipynb' into the directory
	4. Create a directory named 'Dataset' and place the 'A_Z Handwritten Data.csv' file into it.
	5. Now open the 'ipynb' file
	6- You can run your file and finally would get the results

Thank you !


**Extra
	If you want to train the model again then please enable runtime as GPU from
