# A machine learning approach on Handwritten Character Recognition
## This project was done as a part of Machine Learning and Data Mining Lab. 
## Abstract:
This essay offers a thorough analysis of handwritten character recognition (HCR) in the English language. The handwritten character recognition technology has been used in a wide range of industries, including the banking sector, the health care sector, and many other businesses that deal with handwritten papers. The process of turning handwritten text into a machine-readable format is known as handwritten character recognition. There are challenges with handwritten characters since they vary from writer to writer. Even when the same individual writes the same character, there are variations in the character's size, shape, and placement. We've tried to solve the problems by this machine learning project.

## Dataset
We've collected our dataset from Kaggle that contains 37000+ hand written English alphabets.

## Model
After the collection of the dataset, we applied CNN model and tried to predict the accuracy.

## Results
We have used Convolutional Neural Network to perfectly classify the handwritten characters. To evaluate the model, we have considered validation result and test score. According to these parameters, we've found that the testing accuracy is 98% accuracy approximately which is great to detect the handwritten characters. 

## Conclusions
This project is successfully done using convolutional neural network and showed the efficiency. Although not yet reached 100% accuracy, leaves room there for improvement. As this project is done perfectly, we'll keep it on focus to make a project to detect handwritten words and this is the future work there.
